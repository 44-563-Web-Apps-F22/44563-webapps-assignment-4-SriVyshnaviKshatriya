          First produced at the Savoy Theatre on October 7, 1893.</h3>

     <h3 class="Zara">ZAR:</h3>
     <p class="speech">Words of love too loudly spoken<br>
          Ring their own untimely knell;<br>
          Noisy vows are rudely broken,<br>
          Soft the song of Philomel.<br>
          Whisper sweetly, whisper slowly,<br>
          Hour by hour and day by day;<br>   
          Sweet and low as accents holy<br>
          Are the notes of lover's lay.
     </p>

     <h3 class="Both">BOT:</h3>
     <p>Sweet and low, etc.</p>

     <h3 class="Fitz">FIT:</h3>
     <p class="speech">Let the conqueror, flushed with glory,<br>
          Bid his noisy clarions bray;<br>
          Lovers tell their artless story<br>
          In a whispered virelay.<br>
          False is he whose vows alluring<br>
          Make the listening echoes ring;<br>
          Sweet and low when all-enduring<br>
          Are the songs that lovers sing!
     </p>

     <h3 class="Both">BOT:</h3>
     <p class="speech">Sweet and low, etc.</p>

     <p class="direction">(Exit Zara. Enter King dressed as Field-Marshal.)</p>

     <h3 class="King">KIN:</h3>
     <p class="speech">To a Monarch who has been accustomed to the uncontrolled
          use of his limbs, the costume of a British Field-Marshal is,
          perhaps, at first, a little cramping. Are you sure that this is
          all right? It's not a practical joke, is it? No one has a keener
          sense of humor than I have, but the First Statutory Cabinet
          Council of Utopia Limited must be conduct-ed with dignity and
          impressiveness. Now, where are the other five who signed the
          Articles of Association?
     </p>

     <h3 class="Fitz">FIT:</h3>
     <p class="speech">Sir, they are here.</p>

     <p class="direction">(Enter Lord Dramaleigh, Captain Corcoran, Sir Bailey Barre, Mr.
          Blushington, and Mr. Goldbury from different entrances.)
     </p>

     <h3 class="King">KIN:</h3>
     <p class="speech">Oh! (Addressing them) Gentlemen, our daughter holds
          her first Drawing-Room in half an hour, and we shall have time to
          make our half-yearly report in the interval. I am neces-sarily
          unfamiliar with the forms of an English Cabinet
          Councilâ€”perhaps the Lord Chamberlain will kindly put us in
          the way of doing the thing properly, and with due regard to the
          solemnity of the occasion.
