    <h2>UTOPIA LIMITED</h2>
    <h3>ACT II - Throne Room in King Paramount's Palace
        First produced at the Savoy Theatre on October 7, 1893.</h3>

        <p>  Zara:          Words of love too loudly spoken
            Ring their own untimely knell;
       Noisy vows are rudely broken,
            Soft the song of Philomel.
       Whisper sweetly, whisper slowly,
            Hour by hour and day by day;
       Sweet and low as accents holy
            Are the notes of lover's lay.</br>

Both:          Sweet and low, etc.</br>

Fitz:          Let the conqueror, flushed with glory,
            Bid his noisy clarions bray;
       Lovers tell their artless story
            In a whispered virelay.
       False is he whose vows alluring
            Make the listening echoes ring;
       Sweet and low when all-enduring
            Are the songs that lovers sing!</br>

Both:          Sweet and low, etc.</br>

(Exit Zara. Enter King dressed as Field-Marshal.)</br>

King:     To a Monarch who has been accustomed to the uncontrolled
use of his limbs, the costume of a British Field-Marshal is,
perhaps, at first, a little cramping.  Are you sure that this is
all right?  It's not a practical joke, is it?  No one has a keener
sense of humor than I have, but the First Statutory Cabinet
Council of Utopia Limited must be conduct-ed with dignity and
impressiveness.  Now, where are the other five who signed the
Articles of Association?</br>

Fitz.:    Sir, they are here.</br>

(Enter Lord Dramaleigh, Captain Corcoran, Sir Bailey Barre, Mr.
Blushington, and Mr. Goldbury from different entrances.)</br>

King:     Oh!  (Addressing them)  Gentlemen, our daughter holds
her first Drawing-Room in half an hour, and we shall have time to
make our half-yearly report in the interval.  I am neces-sarily
unfamiliar with the forms of an English Cabinet
Councilâ€”perhaps the Lord Chamberlain will kindly put us in
the way of doing the thing properly, and with due regard to the
solemnity of the occasion.</br>
